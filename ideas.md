Secondary Strip
 - Use strip as representation of song - add new led every 16th note representing notes hit. Maybe use MIDI time codes for clocking.
 - Visualization Idea: Have pulse locations on strip for each drum, make them 'explode' based on drum hits and velocity of hits.
 - Different types of visualizations for Drums/Cymbals roughly based on frequency.
Drum Lights
 - Rimshot Visualization - quick light loop around the drum emanating from multiple points.
 - Come up with ways to activate certain special visualizations. Easiest way is specific sequence of notes.
Packaging and Hardware:
 - I'd like to integrate http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/usb-host/usb-host-mini for use with keyboards and other USB devices.
 - If I make a PCB, I want Arduino Nano or similar to plug into it.
